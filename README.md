# Bobble-Detector-Minecraft
A bobble detector for Minecraft Forge 1.19.2.

Adds a simple block that detects when a fish is caught and outputs a redstone signal. 
Additionally the block lights up at the top and bottom whenever a bobber is detected in the search area.
The search area is a 5x5x5 cube in front of the block.

It does not include a crafting recipe, but you can add one with CraftTweaker or KubeJS.

Created to be used together with Create's deployer to create automatic fish farms.
